# CIS for macOS High Sierra - Script and Configuration Profile Remediation
## INFO:

Refers to document CIS_Apple_OSX_10.13_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf, available at https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org

## USAGE:
* Create Extension Attributes using the following scripts:
### 2.5_Audit_List Extension Attribute

Set as Data Type "String."
Reads contents of /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit file and records to Jamf Pro inventory record.

### 2.6_Audit_Count Extension Attribute

Set as Data Type "Integer." 
Reads contents of /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit file and records count of items to Jamf Pro inventory record. Usable with smart group logic (2.6_Audit_Count greater than 0) to immediately determine computers not in compliance.

1. After creation, make note of the ID number of these Extension Attributes.  To find the ID, select the Extension Attribute then click into your browser's address bar.  The ID number is after the "id=" in the URL. 

2. Add the following scripts to your Jamf Pro  
* 1_Set_Organization_Priorities  
* 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG __or__ 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API  
* 3_Security_Remediation

Scripts __1_Set_Organization_Priorities__ and __2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API__ will need additional configuration prior to deployment.

### 1_Set_Organization_Priorities

Admins set organizational compliance for each listed item, which gets written to plist. The values default to "true," meaning if an organization wishes to disregard a given item they must set the value to false by changing the associated comment:

OrgScore1_1="true" or OrgScore1_1="false"

The script writes to /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist by default.

### 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API

Configure the following variables in the script:

* Line 42: Enter your Jamf Pro URL. 
* Lines 52 and 53: The values for "ENTER_SALT_HERE" and "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE" are generated by the Encrypted Strings repo created by Bryson Tyrrell. (https://github.com/brysontyrrell/EncryptedStrings) To generate the values, paste the following into Terminal:
```bash
 function GenerateEncryptedString() {
    # Usage ~$ GenerateEncryptedString "String"
    local STRING="${1}"
    local SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 8)
    local K=$(openssl rand -hex 12)
    local ENCRYPTED=$(echo "${STRING}" | openssl enc -aes256 -a -A -S "${SALT}" -k "${K}")
    echo "Encrypted String: ${ENCRYPTED}"
    echo "Salt: ${SALT} | Passphrase: ${K}"
} 
```

Press return then enter
```bash
GenerateEncryptedString "Username_String"
```
replacing Username_String with a Jamf Pro API username that has PUT permission for Computer Extension Attributes.  Save the output for later use and repeat this step with the API user's password. Enter the respective Salt and Password in lines 52 and 53.
* Line 55: Enter the ID for the Extension Attribute 2.6_Audit_Count
* Line 56: Enter the ID for the Extension Attribute 2.5_Audit_List

* Add the configured script to your Jamf Pro server and configure the parameter labels for parameter 4 (API Username Encrypted String) and parameter 5 (API Password Encrypted String).

* Create a single Jamf Policy using all three scripts.  
1_Set_Organization_Priorities - Script Priority: Before  
2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG __or__ 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API - Script Priority: Before  
3_Security_Remediation - Script Priority: Before  
2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG __or__ 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API - Script Priority: After  

For script 2_Security_Audit_Compliance enter the values generated when you configured lines 52 and 53 in parameters 4 and 5. 

* Policy: Some recurring trigger to track compliance over time. 
__Do not add Update Inventory if using the API script as the API entries in script 2_Security_Audit_Compliance will populate the appropriate Extension Attributes.  If using 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG, add Update Inventory.__

 __2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG or 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API can be used in the policy.__

### 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_ORG

Run this before and after 3_Security_Remediation to audit the Remediation
Reads the plist at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist. For items prioritized (listed as "true,") the script queries against the current computer/user environment to determine compliance against each item.

Non-compliant items are recorded at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit

### 2_Security_Audit_Compliance_API

Run this before and after 3_Security_Remediation to audit the Remediation
Reads the plist at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist. For items prioritized (listed as "true,") the script queries against the current computer/user environment to determine compliance against each item. 

Non-compliant items are recorded at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit. Using the REST API, the values for Extension Attributes 2_5 and 2_6 are updated


### 3_Security_Remediation

Run 2_Security_Audit_Compliance after to audit the Remediation
Reads the plist at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist. For items prioritized (listed as "true,") the script applies recommended remediation actions for the client/user.

SCORED CIS EXCEPTIONS:

- Does not implement pwpolicy commands (5.2.1 - 5.2.8)
